##Here are a couple of exercises I found interesting from Ch. 3.

### Exercise 3.9:

![Ex 3.9](/.imgs/ex3_9.png)
**Solution**

Result 1:
```
(cons 5 (list 6 7))  => (5 6 7)
```

Result 2:
```
(cons 5 '(list 6 7))  => (5 (list 6 7)) 
```

Result 3:
```
(list 3 'from 9 'gives (- 9 3)) =>(3 from 9 gives 6)
```

Result 4:
```
(+ (length '(1 foo 2 moo))
   (third '(1 foo 2 moo))

=>

(+ 4 2) => 6
``

Result 5:
```
(rest '(cons is short for construct)) => (is short for construct)
